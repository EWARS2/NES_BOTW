Crappy attempt at recreating the Legend of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild NES
prototype as a romhack of Zelda I.
(As seen here: https://youtu.be/Bk5swSyJ5zQ )

Because of how the map is compressed/stored in Zelda I,
this really only captures the essence of it.

Todo:
- Change Link's outfit
- Is there a way to change the map's table of column patterns?
- Probably just slap something together in GBStudio instead & call it good enough
- Semi-unrelated: add MSU-1 support to GBStudio
- Test on KrzysioCart (Cheaper Everdrive alternative, very cool)
